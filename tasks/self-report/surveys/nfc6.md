    "Thinking is not my idea of fun.",
    "I would rather do something that requires little thought than something that is sure to challenge my thinking abilities.",
    "I really enjoy a task that involves coming up with new solutions to problems.",
    "I would prefer a task that is intellectual, difficult, and important to one that is somewhat important but does not require much thought."
