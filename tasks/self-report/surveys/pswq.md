var pswq = {
  type: 'survey-template',

    "My worries overwhelm me.",                                                              // Q2; included in 8-item and full version
    "I do not tend to worry about things.",                                                  // Q3; to be reverse-scored; included in full version

    "Once I start worrying, I can't stop.",                                                  // Q14; included in 3-item and full version
