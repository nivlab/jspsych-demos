    "My problems often seem insurmountable.",
    "When I attempt to solve a problem, I often question my abilities.",
    "I often have the impression that my problems cannot be solved.",
    "Even if I manage to find some solutions to my problems, I doubt that they will be easily resolved.",
    "I have a tendency to see problems as a danger.",
    "My first reaction when faced with a problem is to question my abilities.",
    "I often see my problems as bigger than they really are.",
    "Even if I have looked at a problem from all possible angles, I still wonder if the solution I decided on will be effective.",
    "I consider problems to be obstacles that interfere with my functioning."
