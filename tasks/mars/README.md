## Description

The matrix reasoning task, a free-to-use and versatile variant of the Raven's progressive matrices. All materials were retrieved from the [MaRs-IB repository](https://osf.io/g96f4/). The task design is modeled after the [Gorilla version](https://app.gorilla.sc/openmaterials/36164).

## Notes

[Chierchia et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.190232) developed three unique sets of stimuli, all of which reside in the `img` folder. The first image set (`is1`) is the same as used in the manuscript. The latter two image sets (`is2`, `is3`) are colorblind-friendly versions of the image set. Each image set has three unique test-forms (`tf`). Each test form has unique imagery but is matched item-by-item on matrix pattern and dimensionality.

Each puzzle stimulus is accompanied by two sets of four possible choice options. The sets differ in how the distractor choice options were generated. For details, please see [Chierchia et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.190232).

For ease of download, each image set has been compressed and needs to be unpacked before they can be used. To unpack an image set, use the following command:

```unix
tar xvzf file.tar.gz
```

Note: the practice images must also be unpacked in order to run the instructions.
